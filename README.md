# Project Objective

This project aims to utilize econometric techniques, specifically logistic regression, to build a predictive model for credit default. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the goal is to enhance the assessment of credit risk by accurately identifying clients with a higher probability of default.

## Foundation

Utilizing historical data and borrower-specific characteristics like credit history, income, and age, logistic regression is employed to estimate the likelihood of a client defaulting. This technique allows for a more precise evaluation of potential credit default scenarios.

## Advantages

- **Improved Risk Assessment:** The model provides a more accurate identification of clients at risk of default, aiding financial institutions in minimizing potential losses.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Using empirical data enables evidence-based decision-making in credit risk management.

## Potential Improvements

- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional relevant features or refining existing ones could enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuning hyperparameters or trying different algorithms may further improve the model's accuracy.


## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
